# Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model
## SageMakers (AWS Service)
### Project 5:
**Taregt:**
Building and Deploying Neural Networks which predicts the sentiment of a user-provided movie review. And Creating a simple web app that uses the model.

**Steps:**
- Creating LSTM Networks 
- Building and Training the model
- Creating web app using AWS Services (SageMakers, Lambda Function, API Gateway, S3..)

**Output:**

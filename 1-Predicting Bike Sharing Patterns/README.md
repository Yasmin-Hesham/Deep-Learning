# Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns
## Neural Networks
### Project 1:
**Target:** 
Building and Trainig Neural Networks with Python and numpy from _Scratch_  to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day and analyze the data. This project helps building multi-layer neural networks using **PyTorch** as framework.

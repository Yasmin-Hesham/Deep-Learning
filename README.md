# Deep Learning Udacity Nanodegree
 This repository includes the submitted projects to complete Deep Learning Nanodegree by Udacity. This program helps to become expert in neural networks, and learn to implement them using the deep learning framework PyTorch. Build convolutional networks for image recognition, recurrent networks for sequence generation, generative adversarial networks for image generation, and learn how to deploy models accessible from a website using SageMakers which is a service offered by AWS.
### Note: 
Each project's folder contain a brief explanation and illustration.

# Dog Breed Classifier
## Convolutional Neural Networks
### Project 2:
**Taregt:**
Building a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given the imaage of a dog, the algorithm identifies an estimate of the canine's breed.

**Steps:**
- Implementing CNN from scratch and ensuring the test accuracy to be greater than 10% ( output test accuracy = 24%).
- Using Transfer Learning _VGG16_ and ensuring the test accuracy to be greater than 60% ( output test accuracy = 80%).

**Application:**
- Predicting Dog Breed
- Detecting human face and estimating dog breed
- Showing an error input if neither detection human face nor dog.
**Output:**
